With MFA enabled, when a user signs in to an AWS Management Console, they will be prompted for their username and password (the first factor—what they know), as well as for an authentication code from their MFA device (the second factor—what they have). Taken together, these multiple factors provide increased security for AWS account settings and resources."},{question:"Which service can identify the user that made the API call when an Amazon EC2 instance is terminated?",answers:["AWS Trusted Advisor","AWS CloudTrail","AWS X-Ray","AWS Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM)"],correctAnswer:"AWS CloudTrail","the explication":"AWS CloudTrail helps users enable governance, compliance, and operational and risk auditing of their AWS accounts.
